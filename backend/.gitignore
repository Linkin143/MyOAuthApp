A .gitignore file is used in Git to specify files or directories that should be ignored by version control. This helps prevent unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked in your repository.

Hereâ€™s an example of a basic .gitignore file:

Copy the code
# Ignore node_modules folder
/node_modules

# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore environment files
/.env

# Ignore system files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Ignore build directories
dist/
build/

# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp
*.swp

Key Points:
Patterns: You can use wildcards like * to match multiple files or directories.
Exceptions: Use ! to negate a pattern (e.g., !important-file.txt).
Placement: Place the .gitignore file in the root of your repository or in specific directories for localized rules.

Feel free to customize it based on your project's needs!
